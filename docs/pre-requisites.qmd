## Setup

There are two ways to work through the examples and exercises in this workshop.

### In your web browser with Shinylive

Shinylive allows you to run full-featured shiny apps in your browser, and includes a basic editor which is good enough to run examples.

As a result you should be able to work through all of the examples in the workshop using just the browser without installing anything locally.

### Locally with python and VS Code as your IDE

While Shinylive is great, it likely isn't the environment you'll use to develop Shiny apps, and so it makes sense to set up VS Code and run the examples locally. To do this follow these steps before the workshop:

1. Install Python

1.  Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

1.  Install the Shiny for Python [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=posit.shiny-python)

1.  Clone the repository:

     ``` python
     git clone https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-python-workshop-2023.git
     ```
     
     Or alternately download the repository as a zip file: 
     
     ![](../images/git-download-button.png){width="287"}

1.  Navigate to the project directory and create a new virtual environment

    ``` python
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

1.  Set your python interpreter to the virtual environment with `CMD + SHIFT + P` \> `Select Interpreter`

1.  Open a new terminal prompt, which should switch to `(.venv)`

1.  Install the relevant packages

    ```py
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Run some examples

    All of the example apps are stored in the `/apps` directory. The examples are in `apps/examples` and the problem sets are in `apps/problem-sets`. If you've installed the Shiny for Python VS Code extension, you can run any of the apps by opening the `app.py` file and clicking the play button in the top right.

    Alternatively, run these from the command line
    
    ``` py
    shiny run <path-to-app.py> --reload
    ```
