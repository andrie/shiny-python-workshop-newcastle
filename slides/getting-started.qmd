# Setup

## Goals of Session 1

1. Understand the mechanics of a Shiny app (what to do, not why you do it)

1. Develop comfort with failure and debugging

1. You know where to go for help 

## How this session works

- This session is going to be exercise based
- All of the exercises and slides are running live on the [website](https://andrie.github.io/shiny-python-workshop-newcastle/docs/pre-requisites.html)
- You can do them on the website or open the apps in the `apps/problem-sets` folder
- If you need help, put a red sticker on your laptop; when you're done, put up a green sticker

## Testing your setup

1) In a terminal, type `shiny create my-app`
2) Open `my-app/app.py`
3) Click the "Run app" button in the top right of VS Code ([screenshot](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5d947e6dff7d74fd1cf221e79583105c42e4986ae673ce79733ce5edbfdcdda5/68747470733a2f2f7368696e792e7273747564696f2e636f6d2f70792f646f63732f6173736574732f7673636f64652e706e67))
4) If your local setup doesn't work, switch to Posit Workbench and try again


# Hello Shiny

## What's a Shiny app?
```{python}
# | echo: false
# | output: asis

include_shiny_folder(
    "apps/examples/0.0-penguins", components="viewer", viewer_height=700
)
```

## Key features of Shiny

- Easy to develop
- Extensible
- Efficient

## Why Shiny for Python?

- Shiny is designed to take you from prototype to production
- Easy enough to use for prototypes
- Efficient enough to handle complexity
- Everything you need to build production quality apps
- You don't need to throw away your Shiny apps

## Anatomy of a Shiny App

To make a Shiny app work you need to do three things:

1) Add inputs and outputs to the UI
1) Create a rendering function
1) Refer to inputs 

## Inputs and outputs

```{.python code-line-numbers="3-6"}
from shiny import Inputs, Outputs, Session, App, render, ui

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    ui.input_slider("n", "N", 0, 100, 20),
    ui.output_text_verbatim("txt"),
)


def server(input, output, session):
    @output
    @render.text
    def txt():
        return f"n*2 is {input.n() * 2}"


app = App(app_ui, server)
```

## Rendering function

```{.python code-line-numbers="10-12"}
from shiny import Inputs, Outputs, Session, App, render, ui

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    ui.input_slider("n", "N", 0, 100, 20),
    ui.output_text_verbatim("txt"),
)


def server(input, output, session):
    @output
    @render.text
    def txt():
        return f"n*2 is {input.n() * 2}"


app = App(app_ui, server)
```

## Refer to inputs

```{.python code-line-numbers="13"}
from shiny import Inputs, Outputs, Session, App, render, ui

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    ui.input_slider("n", "N", 0, 100, 20),
    ui.output_text_verbatim("txt"),
)


def server(input, output, session):
    @output
    @render.text
    def txt():
        return f"n*2 is {input.n() * 2}"


app = App(app_ui, server)
```

# The user interface

## UI functions

- UI functions are in the `ui` submodule
- Inputs start with `ui.input_*()` and take an id, and options
- Outputs start with `ui.output_*()` and usually just take an id
- Other functions like `ui.h1()` or `ui.p()` add static HTML to the app
- We'll get to layout functions in Session 3

## Your turn

Go to [exercises/1-hello-world](../exercises/1-hello-world.html) or run `apps/problem-sets/1-getting-started/1.0-hello-world` locally.

# The server

## Server function

- Every Shiny app needs a `server` function
- The server function executes for each user session
- This function contains **rendering functions** which define how to turn inputs into outputs

## Rendering functions

```{.python}
def server(input, output, session):
    @output
    @render.text
    def txt():
        return f"n*2 is {input.n() * 2}"
```

- Functions are defined inside the main `server` function
- They need to be **decorated** with `@output` and `@render.*` in that order
- The function **name** should match the output id
- The return value is sent to the Shiny UI

## Decorators are just functions
```{.python}
    @output
    @render.plot(alt="A body mass plot of penguins")
    def mass_plot():
        df = sample_data(penguins.copy(), input.sample())
        df = df.loc[df["body_mass"] < input.mass()]
        return dist_plot(df)
```
- Decorators are functions which take other functions
- Shiny uses them to identify reactive functions
- They can take arguments


## Simple app example

```{.python code-line-numbers="5,10-13"}
from shiny import Inputs, Outputs, Session, App, render, ui

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    ui.input_slider("n", "N", 0, 100, 20),
    ui.output_text_verbatim("txt"),
)


def server(input, output, session):
    @output
    @render.text
    def txt():
        return f"n*2 is {input.n() * 2}"


app = App(app_ui, server)
```


## Common problems

- An output doesn't render
- An output doesn't update when an input changes
- There's some weird error

## Your turn

Go to [exercises/2-debug](../exercises/2-debug.html) or work through exercises 1.1-1.5 locally.

## Connecting inputs to outputs

```{.python code-line-numbers="5"}
def server(input: Inputs, output: Outputs, session: Session):
    @output
    @render.text
    def txt():
        return f"n*2 is {input.n() * 2}"
```

- Inputs are read by calling them like a function: `input.n()`, not `input.n`
- Referring to an input creates a reactive link between that input and the rendering function
- When the input changes, the rendering function will re-execute
- You can use multiple inputs in the same rendering function

## Your turn

Go to [exercises/3-add-filter](../exercises/3-add-filter.html) or work through exercises 1.6-1.9 locally.

# Recap

## Recap

Most Shiny app development consists of variations of these three things:

1) Add UI elements
1) Add rendering functions
1) Connect inputs and outputs


## Your turn

Go to [exercises/4-add-plot](../exercises/4-add-plot.html) or work through exercise 1.10 locally.
